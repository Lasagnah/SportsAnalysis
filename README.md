# SportsAnalysis
## What are we doing?
We will be using Kenneth Massey's method of ranking teams. This method is currently being used by the Bowl Championship Series. 
## Why are we doing this?
Because it's fun. 
Also we prefer to use Massey's method because it can take many different features into account (things like home court advantage, injuries, etc.) as well as teams playing multiple games against eachother. 
## How are we doing this?
We are doing this by using Python. We will be using Numpy for the linear algebra, as well as other libraries for data entry/collection.
## Goals
I would want to use a full regular season as data, and then use the model to "predict"/weigh the winners of the playoff games individually (and by how much). 
## What data set will we use?
I am going to be using the Dinger City Winter 2022 season for my dataset. I chose this because mario superstar baseball is amazing and also its current.
Here is a link to a playlist containing all of the games. [Here is a Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4KAbBInKJ-yDgWyqkUlH4Yyk1n6STYka)
We will be using only the regular season, including the tiebreaker game.
